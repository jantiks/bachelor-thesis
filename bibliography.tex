%%% Bibliography (literature used as a source)
%%%
%%% We employ biblatex to construct the bibliography. It processes
%%% citations in the text (e.g., the \cite{...} macro) and looks up
%%% relevant entries in the bibliography.bib file.
%%%
%%% See also biblatex settings in thesis.tex.

%%% Generate the bibliography. Beware that if you cited no works,
%%% the empty list will be omitted completely.

% We let bibliography items stick out of the right margin a little
\def\bibfont{\hfuzz=2pt}

\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc]

%%% If case you prefer to write the bibliography manually (without biblatex),
%%% you can use the following. Please follow the ISO 690 standard and
%%% citation conventions of your field of research.
