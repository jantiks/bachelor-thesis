In this thesis, we surveyed the results of Hadwiger's conjecture and Kempe chains, focusing on Kriesell and Mohr's results. 
We have worked on computer-assisted graph enumeration to search for counterexamples for $K_6$ to show that it is non-KM-forced in some graph $G$ but found no counterexamples in graphs up to 13 vertices.
We believe that there are counterexamples for $K_6$, but they are larger than 13 vertices, so to find them, 
we would need to use more computational power or a better algorithm. Furthermore, we showed that any minimal counterexample $G$ such that $K_5$ is non-KM-forced in $G$, 
must be 2-connected, which might be a step towards proving the case $k=5$.
